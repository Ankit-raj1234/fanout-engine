============================================================
Assignment 1: Durable Execution Engine (Java)
Location: C:\Users\91637\Desktop\coding\oops

Overview
This project implements a minimal Durable Execution Engine that makes normal Java code durable by wrapping side-effecting work in a step call. On restart, completed steps are loaded from SQLite and never re-executed.

Structure
- engine/: core durable engine library
- examples/onboarding/: Employee Onboarding example workflow
- main/: CLI app to start/resume the workflow and simulate crashes

Build
mvn -q -DskipTests package

Run
java -jar main/target/app-1.0.0.jar --workflow-id employee-1 --db durable.db
java -jar main/target/app-1.0.0.jar --workflow-id employee-1 --db durable.db --crash-at provision-parallel

Design Notes
- Sequence Tracking: Each step(id, ...) uses a monotonically increasing sequence number to support loops and conditionals without collisions.
- Thread Safety: SQLite writes are guarded by a write lock; WAL mode + busy timeout; each operation uses a fresh connection.
- Zombie Step Handling: If a crash happens between execution and commit, policy is RETRY (default) or FAIL via --zombie-policy retry|fail.

Prompts Used (Assignment 1)
1) "read the pdf"
2) "install pypdf2"
3) "generate all code file in java and readme pdf"

Assignment 2: High-Throughput Fan-Out Engine (Java)
Location: C:\Users\91637\Desktop\coding\fanout-engine

Overview
Streaming fan-out engine that ingests large files and distributes records to multiple sink types (REST, gRPC, MQ, Wide-column DB) with transformation, throttling, backpressure, retries, and observability.

Architecture Summary
InputReader -> Source Queue -> Dispatcher -> Per-sink Queues -> Sink Workers
Each sink applies a Strategy Transformer (JSON / Protobuf / XML / Avro+CQL map).

Backpressure & Concurrency
- Bounded queues prevent OOM and propagate backpressure.
- Java 21 virtual threads for sink workers.

Resilience
- Per-sink retries (max 3).
- Failures written to dlq/<sink>.jsonl.

Observability
- Every 5 seconds prints ingested, dispatched, throughput, and per-sink success/failure/retry counts.
